# **Random Adventure**

## Project Notes 02/17/2025
> Took some advice from Danny @ Code: You and decided to
> dabble in oop for some object handling. Removed the list
> created to hold hero info and created a class file. Created
> a Hero class to use instead of a list - used said class to 
> iron out naming and changing character name. Everything looks
> good so far.  
> 
> ***Potential Issue:*** During the type_narration function on naming the
> hero, if the player hits [ENTER] thinking they can speed up/bypass
> the char by char display...the players name defaults blank in the
> initial dialogue. They are prompted for a name change after so I 
> don't know how bothered I am by it.  I did look to see if there was
> a way to prevent that from happening with no luck - I either need to
> Google harder or accept it's just going to be that way. Can I accept that?
> Only time will tell. It's eventually going to need fixed.

## Project Notes 02/16/2025
> Update 2: Deleted over 100 lines of code and reworked
> the menus.  It's a thing of beauty now, and it is not to be
> changed. It's fine. **Remember it's fine**. Adding additional
> menus later is acceptable, just don't screw with the logic.
> 
> Update 1: Got the main menu set up and began working on
> the main process of the program - player naming
> seems to be ironed out. Checked off creation of
> the base class.
